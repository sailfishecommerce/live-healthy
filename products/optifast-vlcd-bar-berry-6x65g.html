These are generally insufficient in magnitude or duration to\u003cbr/\u003ewarrant cessation of the program but check with your GP.\u003cbr/\u003eIN some rare cases, numbness and the appearance of previously unsuspected gallstones have been reported. Rapid weight loss occasionally leads to higher serum uric acid levels and might precipitate an acute attack of gout in a predisposed individual. This may be ameliorated by ensuring adequate fluid intake and including one teaspoon of vegetable oil with the 2 cups of additional vegetables consumed daily. Always check any adverse symptoms with a doctor.\u003cbr/\u003eAlthough the OPTIFAST VLCD Program contains adequate electrolytes for the needs of most individuals, some individuals may become hyponatraemic or hypokalaemic, especially if they are receiving diuretic therapy.
