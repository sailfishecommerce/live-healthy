Corns are thickening of the skin in response to pressure. The thickened skin forms in a small cone-shaped (called a nucleus) that presses into the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cp\u003eIs this the right product for me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cp\u003eScholl 2 in 1 Corn Express Pen is suitable for hard corns on the top of the toes and on the balls of the feet and for soft corns between the toes.

Hard corns usually develop on the tops of toes or on the balls of the feet, the 'point' of the corn nucleus can press on nerve endings. which may cause pain and discomfort, making it uncomfortable to walk. There is often an area of callus/hard skin overlying the corn which will usually be round and yellow. Soft corns develop between the toes where the skin is moist, making the skin of the corn feel rubbery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow can I prevent corns?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cp\u003eCorns are caused by areas of high pressure, often caused by footwear or foot shape. To prevent a corn from developing you need to remove the cause of the pressure.
