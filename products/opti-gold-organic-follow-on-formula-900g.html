Each bottle should be prepared\nindividually. This is a guide only. Your baby may need more or less than\nindicated. Ideally, formula should be prepared just prior to feeding.\nOtherwise, refrigerate prepared formula and use within 24 hours. Solid foods should be offered from 6 months. This product should not be used for infants aged under 6 months. 1.     Wash hands before preparing formula. Sterilise all utensils by boiling in water or\nusing an approved steriliser. 2.     Boil drinking water and allow to cool until lukewarm. Measure the required amount of cooled, boiled water into sterilised feeding bottle. Warm to feeding temperature. 3.     Use only the enclosed scoop. Fill scoop lightly; level off using the built-in leveller.\nDo not compact the powder into the scoop. 4.     Add one level scoop of powder for each 60ml of water. Cap the bottle and shake\nbriskly to dissolve the powder. 5.     Test temperature on wrist and feed immediately. Discard any unfinished formula. Prepare each bottle only as needed. It is safer to use immediately after preparation. Where made up formula is stored prior to use it must be refrigerated and if unused, discard within 24 hours. Solid foods should be offered from 6 months.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","meta_title":"Buy Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g | Free Delivery to HK | Sailfish Online Store","review_rating":2,"rating":5,"sale":true,"sku":"2690325","tags":["Baby Formula"],"vendor":"Opti Gold","rrp":null,"new_sailfish":true,"margin":25,"airtable_group":"toShopify","product_categories":["Personal Care","Baby Care,Baby Formula"],"select_store":"livehealthy","hkd_selling_price":313,"hkd_compare_at_price":0,"product_image":"[object Object]","images":[{"file":{"filename":"optigoldorganicfollowonformula900g-0","content_type":"image/png","width":800,"height":800,"id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0789","length":1013704,"date_uploaded":"2021-12-14T05:14:32.113Z","md5":"39dbc305343f0eddb3045dbcb6ab431a","url":"https://cdn.schema.io/sailfish-e-commerce-limited/61b82837fde00a2b13af0789/39dbc305343f0eddb3045dbcb6ab431a/optigoldorganicfollowonformula900g-0"},"id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af077e"}],"image_alt_text":["Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g back image on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g from Opti Gold on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Care on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK"],"product_type":"Personal Care","product_images":[{"link":"http://host-62-113-119-20.hosted-by-vdsina.ru/Pictures/opti-gold-organic-follow-on-formula-900g_1.jpg","alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af077f"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g back image on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0780"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g from Opti Gold on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0781"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Care on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0782"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0783"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0784"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0785"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0786"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0787"},{"alt":"Opti Gold Organic Follow on Formula 900g and Baby Formula on Sailfish HK","id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af0788"}],"weight_unit":"kg","currency":"USD","slug":"opti-gold-organic-follow-on-formula-900g","delivery":"shipment","tax_class":"standard","date_created":"2021-12-14T05:14:31.907Z","stock_status":null,"id":"61b82837fde00a2b13af077a"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/products/[slug]","query":{"slug":"opti-gold-organic-follow-on-formula-900g"},"buildId":"xxAGoWALs74rRrki-tzfV","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
