Wash your hands thoroughly prior to insertion. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eHOW DO I INSERT THE DIVACUP? It may seem a little daunting at first but it’s easy once you get the hang of it! \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFOLD THE CUP: The team at DivaCup have tested several methods and recommend two different fold options: the U-Fold and the Push Down fold. We recommend you try both fold options to see which one is right for you. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eU-FOLD: Press the sides of the cup between your fingers and fold it in half to create a U. Simple as that! \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePUSH DOWN FOLD: With your index finger on the top rim of the cup, push the rim down into the centre of the cup base to create a triangle. Once you have mastered your folds you are ready to insert your DivaCup! \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eINSERTING THE DIVACUP: While sitting on the toilet or standing with one leg up on the bathtub, gently separate your labia with your free hand. Holding the folded cup between your thumb and forefinger, push the curved edge of the folded cup into your vagina horizontally. Breathe, you’ve got this. Your DivaCup may open before it is fully inserted into your vagina. Don’t worry, this is normal. Continue to gently push the cup into your vagina until the stem is even with the vaginal opening. Inserting the DivaCup too high may cause leaks and make removal difficult. TIP: Aim the folded DivaCup toward your tailbone at the base of your spine, away from the cervix. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eROTATE THE CUP: Once the DivaCup is in your vagina, grip the base of the cup, not the stem, and turn the cup one complete rotation, 360 degrees, in either direction. This will create a seal. TIP: An alternative insertion method is to insert the cup partway into your vagina, rotate it 360 degrees, then push it horizontally the rest of the way. We recommend that first time users try using the DivaCup during the daytime. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eTO PREVENT LEAKING: To prevent leaking, once inserted, try sliding your finger along the outside of the cup and your vaginal wall, pressing gently on the sides of the cup. This should open the cup fully, creating the seal and will make rotation easier. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eTRIM THE STEM: Some DivaCup users find that the stem is too long and causes irritation. If the stem feels uncomfortable, remove the cup and trim the stem slightly, but no shorter than 1/4 inch/0.6 cm. For further instruction, visit our website: www.divacup.com. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eHOW LONG CAN I LEAVE MY DIVACUP IN? Whether you’re on the go, studying for exams or dancing the night away, you can expect no leaks for up to 8 hours. Depending on your menstrual flow, you may have to empty it more frequently. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eHOW DO I REMOVE MY DIVACUP: Before removing your DivaCup you will need clean hands and for those first-time users, some patience. Get comfortable, sit on the toilet, or stand with one leg on the bathtub and gently separate your labia with your fingers. With your forefinger and thumb, gently pull on the stem until you can feel the base of the cup. Pinch the base of the cup. This will break the seal. Gently move the cup from side to side and pull down. This action will remove the cup from your vagina. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eCAUTION: Do not aggressively pull on the stem to remove the cup. This will be painful and you will likely spill the menstrual flow. NEVER use a foreign object, such as tweezers, to remove your DivaCup. Once removed, keep your cup upright so that your flow remains in the cup. Empty the contents and thoroughly wash your DivaCup with warm water and a mild unscented, oil-free soap. For best results, we recommend using the DivaWash®. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","meta_title":"Buy The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 | Free Delivery to HK | Sailfish Online Store","review_rating":4,"rating":4,"sale":true,"sku":"2683322","tags":["Feminine Hygiene"],"vendor":"DivaCup","rrp":"53.95","new_sailfish":true,"margin":30,"airtable_group":"toShopify","product_categories":["Personal Care","Feminine Hygiene,Intimate Hygiene"],"select_store":"livehealthy","hkd_selling_price":411,"hkd_compare_at_price":595,"product_image":"[object Object]","images":[{"file":{"filename":"thedivacupmenstrualcupmodel0-0","content_type":"image/png","width":800,"height":800,"id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a84","length":697732,"date_uploaded":"2021-12-14T03:13:34.017Z","md5":"6cc79e99f86d7772c93369cd5e6b48cd","url":"https://cdn.schema.io/sailfish-e-commerce-limited/61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a84/6cc79e99f86d7772c93369cd5e6b48cd/thedivacupmenstrualcupmodel0-0"},"id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a79"}],"image_alt_text":["The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 back image on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 from DivaCup on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Health \u0026 Personal on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK"],"product_type":"Personal Care","product_images":[{"link":"http://host-62-113-119-20.hosted-by-vdsina.ru/Pictures/the-divacup-menstrual-cup-model-0_1.jpg","alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a7a"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 back image on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a7b"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 from DivaCup on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a7c"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Health \u0026 Personal on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a7d"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a7e"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a7f"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a80"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a81"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a82"},{"alt":"The DivaCup Menstrual Cup Model 0 and Feminine Hygiene on Sailfish HK","id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a83"}],"weight_unit":"kg","currency":"USD","slug":"the-diva-cup-menstrual-cup-model-0","delivery":"shipment","tax_class":"standard","date_created":"2021-12-14T03:13:33.760Z","stock_status":null,"id":"61b80bddfde00a2b13a66a75"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/products/[slug]","query":{"slug":"the-diva-cup-menstrual-cup-model-0"},"buildId":"xxAGoWALs74rRrki-tzfV","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
