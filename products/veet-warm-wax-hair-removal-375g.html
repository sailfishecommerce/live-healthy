IMPORTANT: ALWAYS REMOVE LID BEFORE HEATING THE WAX. To prevent burning: Follow the recommended heating times (timed with a watch). Take care when handling the heated jar as it may be hot. Check the temperature of the wax using the blue rectangle on the spatula: If it is visible, the wax is safe to use. If the word NO appears, the wax is to hot and should be allowed to cool. If the blue rectangle is still visible, carefully apply a small amount of wax on the inside of your wrist to ensure the wax temperature is suitable for use. Designed for use on legs, underarms, bikini line, arms, and face such as upper lip but is not suitable for use on the breast, eyebrows, perianal or genital areas. Do not use on varicose veins, scars, moles, broken, irritated, sunburnt skin, or on skin that has had an adverse reaction to waxes in the past. Check with your doctor before using if you are on any medication which can affect the skin or if you suffer from any skin related disorder. Waxing is not suitable for the elderly or diabetic. Before use, TEST YOUR SKIN REACTION by applying the wax to a small part of the area you wish to treat, following the direction for use. If after 24 HOURS there is no adverse reaction, begin using. If you have not waxed before we recommend starting by removing hair from the legs. Only when you have experience then progress to the sensitive areas of underarm, bikini line, and face. On these we recommend not to wax the same area of skin twice during a waxing session. Do not swallow. KEEP OUT OF REACH PF CHILDREN. In case of ingestion, consult a doctor immediately and show the outer pack. After waxing we recommend waiting 24 hours before using antiperspirant, a perfumed product or before sunbathing. It is normal that your kin turns red after waxing. If you experience a smarting/tingling feeling during use, remove the wax immediately and rinse thoroughly with water. If this sensation persists, seek medical advice. \u003cp\u003eFIRST AID INFORMATION\u003c/p\u003e  For advice, contact a Poisons Information Centre (phone Australia 13 11 26, New Zealand 0800 764 766) or a doctor.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIngredients\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eGlucose, Fructose, Maltose, Water, Citric Acid, Potato Starch, Parfum, Citral, Limonene Linalool.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDirections\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eHow to apply the Wax: Using the correct part of the spatula, apply thin layers of wax onto the skin in the direction of hair growth. The thinner the layer, the more effective the results. The area covered by the wax should be shorter than the strips. Never cover the whole area with wax in one go. How to remove the wax: Immediately place the strip over the layer of wax, ensuring that there is at least 1 cm at the bottom which is wax free. Smooth the strip over the wax in the direction of hair growth. Hold the skin taut with one hand and with the other hand, grip the bottom of the strip. In one swift and decisive movement, remove the strip against the direction of hair growth. Never lift the strip upwards, but keep it parallel and as close to the skin as possible. To relieve discomfort, apply pressure on your skin with your hands. Repeat as necessary. The same strip can be used several times. How to use on individual areas: Legs: Apply wax from knee to ankle. Remove the strip from ankle to knee. Underarms: To reduce any excess of moisture, we strongly recommend applying talcum powder before waxing. Cut the fabric strip to a suitable size. Underarm hair tends to grow in 2 different directions, so requires removing in 2 stages. Lift the elbow up and well back for the skin to be taut. Use the correct part of the spatula to apply the wax. For the upper part of the underarm, apply the wax in thin layers upwards towards the elbow. For the lower part of the underarm, apply the wax in the opposite direction. Remove the strips against the direction of hair growth. Bikini Line: Cut the fabrics to a suitable size. Only use on small areas at a time. Use the correct end of the spatula to apply the wax. Hold the skin taut, and apply a thin layer of wax in the direction of hair growth. remove the strip against the direction of hair growth. Upper Lips: Treat each side of your lip (left and right) separately. cut the fabric strip to size. Use the correct part of the spatula to apply the wax. Hold the skin taut and apply a thin layer of wax above one side of the upper lip in the direction of hair growth. Repeat on the other side of the lip. After Waxing: This wax water-rinsable allowing you to rinse off any residues with water. After use, strips may be rinsed by hand with water only, and dried in order to be re-used for the next hair removal session. Rinse the spatula with warm water and allow to dry before putting it back into the box. Using a damp cloth, remove the excess wax from the edges of the jar and the lid before closing it. During this, it is important that the wax does not come into contact with water as it becomes ineffective. Heating in the Microwave: Always check the heating times with a watch to ensure safe use. Heat the wax in your microwave as per the guidelines below, at full power. Heating in Water on Stove: Fill a saucepan with water, ensuring the water level is not higher than the wax content in the jar. Once the water has boiled, reduce the heating to minimum and simmer the jar as per the guidelines in the table below. Do not allow saucepan to boil dry or the water to come into contact with the wax or the wax to boil as this will render it ineffective. \u003cp\u003eUSAGE ADVICE\u003c/p\u003e  Wax Application and Removal: Important: For best results, hair should be at least 5 mm long. Skin must be clean and dry, not irritated and free from creams and oils. If you have not waxed before we recommend to start by removing the hair from the legs. Only when you have experience then progress to the sensitive areas of underarm and bikini line. On those we recommend not to wax the same area of skin twice during a waxing session. How to use the spatula: The Precision Spatula is adapted to different body parts. Always hold the spatula by the part with the Veet Logo. Use the hollowed part to apply the wax on legs. use the round part to apply the wax on underarms. Use the flat end to apply the wax on bikini line. Use the corner to apply the wax on the upper lip. Beautician Tips: To soothe the skin after strip removal, immediately apply pressure with your hand. Always wax in advance to allow time for any redness to disappear. To avoid ingrown hair after waxing, exfoliate and moisturise your skin regularly.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","meta_title":"Buy Veet Warm Wax Hair Removal 375g | Free Delivery to HK | Sailfish
