Now you can with our Simple Kind to Skin Moisturising Facial Wash Gel. It hydrates while cleansing and exfoliating; washing away impurities without leaving your skin feeling tight or dry. It's TLC for your face. Our Simple face wash helps maintain the skin's natural barrier, which is so important when you're outside dealing with everyday pollution. Specially formulated for even the most sensitive skin, our facial wash contains no artificial perfume or colour, no alcohol, and no harsh chemicals that can upset your skin. Enriched with vitamin B5, which is known to actively restore, soften, and smooth skin; this skin cleanser is also perfect for dry skin. Our Simple wash formula doesn't clog pores, is hypoallergenic and it's safe to use around your eyes. It's 100% soap-free and, like all our Simple face products, this face wash is dermatologically tested. We believe in continuously working to be kinder to the planet. That's why this cleanser is vegan and Simple is certified cruelty-free by PETA, meaning we don't test on animals anywhere in the world. Want to know how to get the most out of your face wash? Use it in the morning and at night as part of your skincare routine, and don't forget to pay special attention to your hairline and the sides of your nose as that's where dirt and make-up can build up. It's always best to apply a toner and moisturiser after cleansing with a Simple face cleanser. For best results: Wet your face with warm water, squeeze a small amount into hands and massage gently in a circular motion onto wet skin. Rinse with warm water and pat dry. Result: feel fresh and zingy to face up to anything life throws at you! \u003cp\u003eBoxed Contents:  150mL\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSize:  150mL\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKEY FEATURES\u003c/p\u003e  • Simple Kind to Skin Moisturising Facial Wash Gel removes dirt, oil and make-up, leaving skin feeling clean and revived\u003cbr/\u003e • This moisturising, 100% soap-free, vegan face wash gently washes away make-up and impurities, leaving skin feeling hydrated, soft and replenished\u003cbr/\u003e • Our Simple facial wash is made with skin-loving ingredients, such as pro-vitamin B5, vitamin E and Bisabolol, leaving your face feeling clean and refreshed\u003cbr/\u003e • Enjoy a 100% soap-free face wash that is dermatologically tested, approved and safe for those sensitive areas around your eyes\u003cbr/\u003e • A cleansing and hydrating face wash that is an ideal way to add zing to your morning or evening skincare routine\u003cbr/\u003e • This moisturising face wash is vegan and Simple is certified cruelty-free by PETA, meaning we don't test on animals anywhere in the world\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWarnings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAustralian Dollar \u003cp\u003eESSENTIAL SAFETY INFORMATION\u003c/p\u003e  Avoid direct contact with eyes.
