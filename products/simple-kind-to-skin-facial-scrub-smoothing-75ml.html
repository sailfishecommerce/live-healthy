Perfect for even sensitive skin. Our special blend of Simple cleansing goodness containing Pro-Vitamin B5, Vitamin E and Rice Granules, helps to gently exfoliate and improve skin condition. For best results: Apply a small amount to damp face and neck. Massage in circular movements with fingertips avoiding the eye area. Rinse away with plenty of water. Use once a week on normal/dry skin and twice a week on oily skin. Simple have been the experts in sensitive skin since launching the first perfume and colour-free soap in 1960. We've stayed committed to our original philosophy of creating skincare products suitable for all skin types and as our product range has grown. For over 50 years, we've pioneered a kinder approach to skin. In fact, it's become something of an obsession. Over time we've really got to understand skin; what it does and the everyday challenges it faces. We've learnt that when something is as delicate and precious as skin, it deserves only the kindest care.
