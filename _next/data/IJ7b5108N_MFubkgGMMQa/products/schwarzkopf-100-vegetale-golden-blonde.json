Wash your hair using a mild shampoo. Do not use any conditioner, treatments or styling products.<br/>2. Towel-dry and comb through your hair.<br/>3. Put on provided gloves.<br/>4. Pour plant powder into a non-metallic bowl. Boil water and let it sit for a few minutes until water reaches a temperature of about 80°C. Using a brush or a non-metallic implement, mix powder with about 225ml of hot water and stir well until it reaches a creamy, not too runny consistency that is easy to apply. Add water if needed (up to 240ml). <br/>5. Protect your clothing by placing a towel around your shoulders. Separate your hair into smaller sections for an application.<br/><br/>APPLICATION<br/>IMPORTANT: Do not apply if the mixture is too hot, to avoid scalp burns.<br/>Keep the powder plant mixture warm. If you expect you will need more than 10min for application, you can place the bowl with the powder plant mixture into a warm water bath, so it retains the optimal temperature.<br/>6. Using a brush or your hands wearing the gloves, apply the colouration first to your roots and then work your way down to the tips. Do this for each section of hair until all of the hair is covered.<br/>7. In the case of a leftover mixture, spread it all over the hair and massage it in with your hands.<br/>8. After you are done with applying 100% Végétale, cover the hair with the enclosed cap and wrap a towel around it, if preferred, to keep your hair warm. Depending on your hair texture and the desired colour result, you can adjust the application<br/>time. For subtle colour tones, we recommend an application time of 30 minutes. For a more intense colour result, leave the mixture in for 60 minutes. Remove colour residues and stains from the skin if necessary. The unused mixture should be discarded straight after application.<br/>For root application tips &amp; tricks, please refer to www.schwarzkopf.com/100%Vegetal<br/><br/>RINSING<br/>9. Put the gloves back on and take off the towel and cap. Rinse hair thoroughly to remove all colour residues. Use only water without any shampoo, and rinse until the water runs clear.<br/>10. The ultra-gentle 100% Végétale formula will leave your hair with a beautiful shine and feeling smooth - so that no additional conditioning is not needed! <p>USAGE ADVICE</p>  The amount of product is suitable for use on shoulder-length hair. After opening the sachet, the product has to be used completely. It cannot be stored. If you have coloured your hair using 100% Végétale, we do not recommend chemically lighten/bleach or straighten your hair afterwards. Please stick to the application ranges as indicated on the pack. The final colour result depends on your initial hair colour as well as your individual hair structure. Please be aware that when you have more than 30 % grey hair, the colour result will naturally be lighter and more transparent. As all hair is individual, we recommend doing a strand test before the first application.
