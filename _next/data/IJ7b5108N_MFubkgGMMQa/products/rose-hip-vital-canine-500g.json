It's a clinically proven non-swabbable natural anti-inflammatory, powerful antioxidant, rich source of natural Vitamin C, and the first natural product registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) since the introduction of new guidelines in 2009 (Approval # 66404/53576).</li>\n<li>For more than 10 years Rose-Hip Vital has been available in pharmacies and health food stores for human consumption for the treatment of Arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It is the number 1 selling natural anti-inflammatory in pharmacy. In September 2012 Rose-Hip Vital Canine was approved by the APVMA and after a 3 year process, Rose-Hip Vital Equine was also approved in October 2013.</li>\n<li>Rose-Hip Vital powder is manufactured in Denmark with patented extraction and drying processes that isolate and activate a registered compound called GOPO. These same processes also ensure the final product has a high concentration of vitamins and minerals. GOPO has scientifically proven anti-inflammatory properties which discourage excess white blood cells from gathering around inflamed tissue, thereby breaking the cycle of inflammation. The potent Vitamin C and Antioxidant combination provide significant support to the immune system which helps discourage the attack on joints as well as providing a wide range of health benefits.  For example, the human version is helping people with Rheumatoid Arthritis which is an autoimmune disease.</li>\n<li>Rose-Hip Vital is backed by more than 30 scientific studies, including 8 clinical trials (2 on horses, 1 on dogs and 6 on people) unique to the Rose-Hip Vital brand. It’s the only product worldwide which contains the patented compound GOPO. There are no known side-effects or contraindications. </li>\n<li>Feedback we are constantly receiving from people about themselves, their dogs, or their horses is telling us that our product is more effective than any other they have tried previously and they continue to use it because of significant and obvious benefits. </li></ul>\n<p>What is Rose-Hip Vital Canine used for?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Joint pain and Joint mobility</li>\n<li>Preventative for joint problems</li>\n<li>Osteoarthritis/Degenerative Joint Disease</li>\n<li>Immune system support</li>\n<li>General health and well-being</li>\n<li>Coat quality, skin conditions, allergies</li>\n<li>Recovery after surgery, injury or exercise</li>\n<li>Luxating Patella, Hip Dysplasia and Cruciate Ligament<br/></li></ul></div>\n</div>","meta_title":"Buy Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g | Free Delivery to HK | Sailfish Online Store","review_rating":173,"rating":4,"sale":true,"sku":"2654125","tags":["Dogs"],"vendor":"Rose-Hip Vital","rrp":"99.95","new_sailfish":true,"margin":30,"airtable_group":"toShopify","product_categories":["Health","Vitamins,Rose-Hip Vital Canine,Warehouse"],"select_store":"livehealthy","hkd_selling_price":588,"hkd_compare_at_price":921,"product_image":"[object Object]","images":[{"file":{"filename":"rose-hipvitalcanine500g-0","content_type":"image/png","width":800,"height":800,"id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae75","length":741860,"date_uploaded":"2021-12-14T04:00:18.789Z","md5":"e2b6b9702023602ce10a38e219e98c88","url":"https://cdn.schema.io/sailfish-e-commerce-limited/61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae75/e2b6b9702023602ce10a38e219e98c88/rose-hipvitalcanine500g-0"},"id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae6a"}],"image_alt_text":["Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g back image on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g from Rose-Hip Vital on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Pet Care on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK"],"product_type":"Health","product_images":[{"link":"http://host-62-113-119-20.hosted-by-vdsina.ru/Pictures/rose-hip-vital-canine-500g-(online-only)_1.jpg","alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae6b"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g back image on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae6c"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g from Rose-Hip Vital on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae6d"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Pet Care on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae6e"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae6f"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae70"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae71"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae72"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae73"},{"alt":"Rose-Hip Vital Canine 500g and Dogs on Sailfish HK","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae74"}],"weight_unit":"kg","currency":"USD","slug":"rose-hip-vital-canine-500g","delivery":"shipment","tax_class":"standard","date_created":"2021-12-14T04:00:18.509Z","stock_status":null,"category_index":{"sort":{"61c75371e48a266996513212":0,"61c753916fd3256a051bf74b":0,"61c753b1d53c096a5f09de3a":0,"61c753d13fa38d69c1348c74":0,"61c753f110a8a569ba0b7ba1":489},"id":["61c75371e48a266996513212","61c753916fd3256a051bf74b","61c753b1d53c096a5f09de3a","61c753d13fa38d69c1348c74","61c753f110a8a569ba0b7ba1"]},"date_updated":"2021-12-26T23:35:40.172Z","id":"61b816d2fde00a2b13aaae66"}},"__N_SSG":true}
