Ensure that the scar is clean and dry. Apply a very thin layer of Strataderm to the scar and allow to dry. Strataderm should be applied once daily, or twice daily to exposed areas or as advised by your physician. For best results Strataderm should maintain continuous contact with the skin (24 hours a day/ 7 days a week). When applied correctly, Strataderm should be dry in 3–4 minutes. If it takes longer to dry you have probably applied too much. Gently remove the excess with a tissue and allow the drying process to continue. Once dry, Strataderm can be covered with sunscreen, cosmetics, pressure garments or casts.</p></div>\n</div>","meta_title":"Buy Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g | Free Delivery to HK | Sailfish Online Store","review_rating":53,"rating":4,"sale":true,"sku":"2677889","tags":["Scar & Stretchmark Treatments"],"vendor":"Strataderm","rrp":"56.95","new_sailfish":true,"margin":30,"airtable_group":"toShopify","product_categories":["Beauty","Scar Treatment"],"select_store":"livehealthy","hkd_selling_price":454,"hkd_compare_at_price":616,"product_image":"[object Object]","images":[{"file":{"filename":"stratadermscartherapysilicongel20g-0","content_type":"image/png","width":800,"height":800,"id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87277","length":654328,"date_uploaded":"2021-12-14T03:32:30.728Z","md5":"f9fd050931475f50ed23dbe79bbe4dfa","url":"https://cdn.schema.io/sailfish-e-commerce-limited/61b8104efde00a2b13a87277/f9fd050931475f50ed23dbe79bbe4dfa/stratadermscartherapysilicongel20g-0"},"id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a8726c"}],"image_alt_text":["Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g back image on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g from Strataderm on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Skin Care on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK"],"product_type":"Beauty","product_images":[{"link":"http://host-62-113-119-20.hosted-by-vdsina.ru/Pictures/strataderm-scar-therapy-silicon-gel-20g_1.jpg","alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a8726d"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g back image on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a8726e"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g from Strataderm on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a8726f"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Skin Care on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87270"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87271"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87272"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87273"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87274"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87275"},{"alt":"Strataderm Scar Therapy Silicon Gel 20g and Scar & Stretchmark Treatments on Sailfish HK","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87276"}],"weight_unit":"kg","currency":"USD","slug":"strataderm-scar-therapy-silicon-gel-20g","delivery":"shipment","tax_class":"standard","date_created":"2021-12-14T03:32:30.508Z","stock_status":null,"category_index":{"sort":{"61c7528ed53c096a5f00f79a":0,"61c752ae0c19ef69da8e6d76":0,"61c752ced53c096a5f03101f":0,"61c752efe48a2669964c863e":0,"61c7530f7948d36a2594f405":410},"id":["61c7528ed53c096a5f00f79a","61c752ae0c19ef69da8e6d76","61c752ced53c096a5f03101f","61c752efe48a2669964c863e","61c7530f7948d36a2594f405"]},"date_updated":"2021-12-26T23:21:00.305Z","id":"61b8104efde00a2b13a87268"}},"__N_SSG":true}
