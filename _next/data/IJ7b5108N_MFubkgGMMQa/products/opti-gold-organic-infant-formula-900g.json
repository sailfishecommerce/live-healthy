Fill scoop lightly; level off using the built-in leveller.\nDo not compact the powder into the scoop. 4.     Add one level scoop of powder for each 60ml of water. Cap the bottle and shake\nbriskly to dissolve the powder. 5.     Test temperature on wrist and feed immediately. Discard any unfinished formula. Prepare each bottle only as needed. It is safer to use immediately after preparation.
