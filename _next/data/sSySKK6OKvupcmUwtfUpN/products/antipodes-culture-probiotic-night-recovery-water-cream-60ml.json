Kalibiome AGE Probiotic is a natural bacteria, made from human skin cells, that seals the skin’s epidermal layers, so reducing water loss and protecting against irritants such as pollution.  \nCleverly utilised in this certified vegan moisturiser, Kailibiome AGE Probiotic supports firmer skin and reduced wrinkles*. The clean, 100% natural formulation is effective and certified vegan.\nWater levels are boosted thanks to plant-based hyaluronic acid and native New Zealand mamaku black fern. Hyaluronic acid holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water, so is efficient at keeping the skin deeply hydrated. Mamaku black fern, an iconic New Zealand native plant, contains glycosides, or natural sugars, that help to balance and renew the skin’s surface. The divine fragrances of deep fresh rose, citronella and geranium will let your drift into a deep and rejuvenating sleep.   \nThis natural night cream is suited to all skin types, especially tired, sensitive, or generally stressed skin. For best results, use every night before retiring to bed. \nFormulated with probiotic good bacteria* for healthier looking skin. Certified vegan by the UK Vegetarian Society (VegSoc) – the oldest and most respected vegetarian organisation in the world. Like all Antipodes® products, Culture Probiotic Night Recovery Water Cream is 100% natural and free from toxic ingredients including parabens, sulphates, petrochemicals, and artificial fragrances.\n*kalibiome probiotics/postbiotics 600: clinically shown to revitalise extracellular matr</div>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<div>Aqua (water), glycerine, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium acrylates copolymer &amp; lecithin, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) oil, dehydroacetic acid, benzyl alcohol, glyceryl caprylate, bisabolol, sodium hyaluronate, xanthan gum &amp; lecithin &amp; sclerotium gum &amp; pullulan, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf extract, organic, Lactobacillus ferment, mannitol, maltodextrin, sodium citrate, Cyathea medullaris (mamaku) black fern extract, Phormium tenax (harakeke) flax extract, Hibiscus sabdariffa (hibiscus) flower extract, mica, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, manganese violet, Fragrance of Deep Fresh Rose: citral†, citronellol†, geraniol†, d-Limonene†, linalool†. </div>\n<h2>Directions</h2>\n<div>Gently smooth a generous layer of this light natural moisturiser over your face and neck every night after cleansing and toning.
