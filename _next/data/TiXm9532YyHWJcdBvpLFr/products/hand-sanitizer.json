Keep all plastic bags away from children. Like most articles of clothing, pants will burn if exposed to flame. This overnight pant contains pulp and super absorbent polymers. When wet these polymers become gel-like. If you notice a small amount, simply wipe off.</div>\n\n<h2>Common Uses</h2>\n<div>BabyLove CosiFit Nappies with Cosi Contour Technology, designed to wrap snuggly &amp; evenly around baby's body, preventing both redmarks and leaks.</div>\n\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<div><p>The padding inside is made of a mixture of wood pulp and a Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) called Polyacrylate. The SAP starts in a crystal form and is turned into a gel when wet.  This, combined with the wood pulp, helps to prevent nappy leakage. However, sometimes the gel crystals can be found on your baby's skin during use. <br/>• The outer cover of the nappies use a non woven material and a polythene back <br/>• DRIwave Layer to help distribute fluid evenly through the nappy <br/>• An adhesive to hold the nappy together <br/>• Lycra elastic <br/>• Leakage control guards that work as a barrier to help prevent leakage. </p>\n<p> </p></div>\n\n<h2>Directions</h2>\n<div>Bring the front of nappy between baby's legs and across their tummy. Attached the grip tabs to the fastening panel and use the numbers to ensure an even fit. Straighten the leg cuffs outwards and adjust them for a comfy fit.</div>\n</div>","name":"BabyLove Cosifit Nappies Junior 15 Pack","price":8.99,"sku":"2688918","slug":"baby-love-cosifit-nappies-junior-15-pack","stockStatus":null,"stockTracking":true,"tags":["Personal Care","Baby Care","Baby Nappies"],"metaTitle":"Buy BabyLove Cosifit Nappies Junior 15 Pack on Sailfish HK | Free Shipping","metaDescription":"Nappy"},{"id":"61afccbe77f9a11f1dd4efb6","content":{"productBenefits":[{"icon":"uil:truck","text":"Free US shipping on all orders over $100"},{"icon":"uil:clock-two","text":"Free returns up to 30 days"},{"icon":"uil:award","text":"98% customer satisfaction rating"}],"maxQuantity":99},"currency":"USD","description":"<div>\n\n<h2>General Information</h2>\n<div><ul>\n<li>Premium 6 Layer 3D Face Mask</li>\n<li>Will cover your nose, mouth and face</li>\n<li>Features a three-dimensional 5ply mesh filter</li>\n<li>Aim to reduce inhalation of dust, ashes, pollen, car exhaust, passive smoking, airborne germs and other air pollutants</li>\n<li>Include an elastic ear loop  (strap)</li>\n<li>Must be washed by hand for reuse</li>\n<li>Material: Cotton Blend (65%polyester/35% Cotton)</li>\n<li>Dimensions: 10cm width per side (Either side of nose) x 15cm height (Coverage of face) - Covering from under eyes including - nose, mouth and face.</li>\n<li>9cm-11cm stretch elastic to allow fit for most adults (We recommend Med for Kids and ladies)</li>\n<li>Not for commercial use - personal use ONLY</li>\n<li>Available in 2 sizes (Medium and Large) and 2 Colours Black and Navy</li></ul>\n<p>Premium Extra Thick Reuseable washable Industrial weight Australian Made Face Mask</p>\n<p>Face mask multi-use and washable (No of uses varies based on How long mask is worn or How often washed) - Stay safe</p>\n<p>Please only hand wash and follow recommended care instructions</p>\n<p>Sewn in 5 ply filter with outer layer premium thick lightweight cotton/polyester blend industrial strength fabric</p>\n<p>Three - dimensional 5ply 85gm filter 100% polypropylene</p>\n<p>These masks are manufactured for the purpose of personal and family protection</p>\n<p>Recommended use - please replace mask</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the Mask filter starts to ball Up.</li>\n<li>When the Mask Filter seems to have any damage or fluffy Not for commercial use – personal use ONLY<br/></li></ul></div>\n</div>","name":"My Medical Re-usable Mask Large Black","price":9,"sku":"2694340","slug":"my-medical-re-usable-mask-large-black","stockStatus":null,"stockTracking":true,"tags":["Medicines","First Aid","Face Mask"],"metaTitle":"Buy My Medical Re-usable Mask Large Black on Sailfish HK | Free Shipping","metaDescription":"Premium 6 Layer 3D Face Mask Will cover your nose, mouth and face Features a three-dimensional 5ply mesh filter Aim to reduce inhalation of dust, ashes, pollen, car exhaust, passive smoking, airborne germs and other air pollutants Include an elastic ear loop (strap) Must be washed by hand for reuse Material: Cotton Blend (65%polyester/35% Cotton) Dimensions: 10cm width per side (Either side of nose) x 15cm height (Coverage of face)- Covering from under eyes including - nose, mouth and face. 9cm-11cm.."},{"id":"616a8cddd8a27d138bc01270","content":{"productBenefits":[{"icon":"uil:truck","text":"Free US shipping on all orders over $100"},{"icon":"uil:clock-two","text":"Free returns up to 30 days"},{"icon":"uil:award","text":"98% customer satisfaction rating"}],"maxQuantity":99},"currency":"USD","description":"&bull;
