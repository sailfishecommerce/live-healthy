Thanks to its “gentle-fresh” texture, it makes the skin feel fresh and comfortable immediately. The unique formula of the Redness-Relief Refreshing Cleansing Lotion is made up of three key ingredients that help soothe heat sensations caused by redness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avène Thermal Spring Water: naturally soothing and anti-irritating </li>\n<li>TRP-Regulin: relieves sensations of discomfort and improves the tolerance threshold of sensitive skin</li>\n<li>Pongamia oil: helps maintain proper balance in the skin’s ecosystem</li></ul>\n<p>Fragrance free, alcohol free and paraben free, the formula is hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic.<br/>Apply morning and evening with a cotton pad or with fingertips by massaging in light circular movements.
