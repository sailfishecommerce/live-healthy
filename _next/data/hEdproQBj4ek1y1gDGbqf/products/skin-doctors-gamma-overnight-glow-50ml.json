It is the most effective AHA due to it's small molecular structure that allows it to penetrate the surface of the skin more readily. It acts as a mild exfoliant to remove dry skin cells and enhance cell turnover.Lactic Acid - a type of Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) derived from sour milk, it exfoliates by loosening or breaking up the thick outer layer of the skin. This exfoliation, or epidermal shedding, smoothes the skin's texture and stimulates natural skin cell regeneration. It also increases the water holding ability of the skin, helping to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Salicylic Acid - a type of Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) which encourages sloughing of dead skin cells and has the ability to penetrate into the pore to clear out and unclog.Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A) - increases cell renewal, evens the skin tone, improves the texture and firmness of the skin.Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice - extracted from the leaf of the aloe plant, it helps rebalance the pH level in the skin acting as a gentle astringent, firming and toning, as well as protecting the skin against blemishes. Aloe Vera creates a barrier that prevents moisture loss from the skin and carries important nutrients and moisture through the many layers of the skin down tothe dermis, stimulating cells responsible for the manufacture of collagen. It also soothes the skin and reduces redness and swelling.All Ingredients:Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycolic Acid,Benzophenone-3, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Lactic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Ceteareth-20, Salicylic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Retinol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool.</div>\n<h2>Directions</h2>\n<div>Usage: Face, neck, décolletage, avoid the eye area.
