Suitable for all contact lens wearers.</p> <p><strong>Why Preservative Free?</strong></p><p>Like so many people these days, you may be taking an active interest in your health - exercising, watching your weight and being more careful about the ingredients in all the products you use. REFRESH® eye drops are preservative free and will not cause allergies or adverse reactions associated with eye drop preservatives.</p><p>People with sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers can confidently use REFRESH® eye drops.</p><p><strong>Why Sterile Single-Use Containers?</strong></p><p>Eye drops are prone to bacterial contamination and are therefore generally discarded 4 weeks from the time of first opening the bottle. REFRESH® eye drops are different. Each single-use container remains sterile until it is opened. Therefore there is no need to discard REFRESH® eye drops like bottled eye drops.</p><p>Additionally, the single-use containers of REFRESH® eye drops are convenient and easy to carry.</p><p>REFRESH® eye drops provide comfortable relief of irritated, dry and tired eyes. They can also be used for in-eye re-wetting of contact lenses.</p><p>STERILE A.</p> <p>Suitable For:  All contact lens wearers.</p> <p>Size:  30 x 0.4 mL</p></div>\n<h2>Warnings</h2>\n<div>For external use only.
