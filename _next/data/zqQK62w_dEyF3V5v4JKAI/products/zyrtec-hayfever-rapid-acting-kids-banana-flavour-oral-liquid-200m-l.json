Your body releases chemicals, one of which is called histamine. Histamine is responsible for causing most of your symptoms.</p> </div>\n<div><a title=\"\"></a>\n<p><strong>How do antihistamines work?</strong></p>\n<p>Antihistamines work by blocking the site where histamines bind to which help stop an allergy response. Zyrtec? contains the antihistamine cetirizine which provides fast, 12 hour symptom relief.</p> </div>\n<div><a title=\"\"></a>\n<p><strong>Indoor allergies</strong></p>\n<p>Include mould, dust, and pet dander and can cause allergy symptoms at home and at work. Since indoor allergies can take effect any time of year. Understanding and recognizing the symptoms is half the battle when fighting indoor allergies.</p> </div>\n<div><a title=\"\"></a>\n<p><strong>Outdoor allergies</strong></p>\n<p>Produced by plants, trees, grass, and weeds. Pollen, the most common outdoor allergen, is lightweight and can easily become airborne. Pollination plays a key role in the spread of outdoor allergens.</p> </div> </div>\n<h3>Allergy Myth-Busting</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"\"></a> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>MYTH: All antihistamines make you drowsy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BUSTED:</strong> While some older antihistamines can cause drowsiness (the ones behind the counter), newer antihistamines are classed as less sedating antihistamines, meaning they are less likely to cause drowsiness</p> </div> </div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"\"></a> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>MYTH: You can build tolerance to antihistamines (AH)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BUSTED:</strong> Changes in air pollution, air temperature, increased exposure to allergens and development of new allergies may make it seem like AH are not working as well as before.</p> </div> </div> </div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"\"></a> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>MYTH: You shouldn't take antihistamines daily.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BUSTED:</strong> Antihistamines such as Zyrtec, are indicated for the relief of hayfever and allergy symptoms and can be taken once a day to provide relief from allergy symptoms.</p> </div> </div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"\"></a> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>MYTH: Allergies are harmless.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BUSTED:</strong> Allergies are a prevalent problem in Australia and should not be ignored.
