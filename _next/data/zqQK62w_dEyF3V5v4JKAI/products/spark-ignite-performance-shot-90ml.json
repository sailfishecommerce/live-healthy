The 3 Sparks (our active ingredients) have been carefully selected on the back of extensive scientific research to not only exert their effect in isolation but potentiate each other's actions and ignite your performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Spark 1 (S1)</strong></p>\n<p>Research* has shown unequivocal evidence that through the regular use of this amino acid we can boost the body's carnosine content.</p>\n<p>It's the action of this carnosine that is most significant in its workings inside the membrane of our muscle cells. The carnosine acts as an intra-cellular buffer, helping to maintain cell pH levels during exercise and subsequently allowing higher quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Spark 2 (S2)</strong></p>\n<p>Another amino acid, this time helping to promote arousal levels and have you mentally primed to take on any type of training or competition and assist you to execute this at the highest possible level.</p>\n<p>S2's effectiveness comes from its role as a building block of Dopamine, a neurotransmitter active in the brain that competes against Serotonin to help drive our motivation, concentration, alertness and arousal.</p>\n<p>By assisting the body's natural production of Dopamine, we can help ensure the mind is ready to perform too.</p>\n<p><strong>Spark 3 (S3)</strong></p>\n<p>S3 is a group of water-soluble molecules required in higher amounts in active individuals. These micronutrients are necessary during the body's process of converting proteins and sugars into energy and are used during the production and repair of cells, including red blood cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Caffeine</strong></p>\n<p>Spark contains a very small amount of caffeine (32mg), less than you would find in a cup of coffee. It’s presence is not designed to promote a glycogen sparing effect (~3mg/kg body weight), nor will it have you temporarily 'wired' then leave you with plummeting levels of alertness. Rather, it will serve as an adjunct to S2, assisting with the promotion of optimal arousal levels and assist with breaking through your performance barriers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Spark Experience:</strong></p>\n<p>10-15 minutes after taking Spark, you will likely feel the onset of some tingles (paraesthesia) as S1 kicks in. This is the start of the cascade of biochemical reactions preparing your body and mind to perform at its best.</p>\n<p>*The effect of ß-alanine and NaHCO3 co-ingestion on buffering capacity and exercise performance with high-intensity exercise in healthy males.<br/>Danaher J1, Gerber T, Wellard RM, Stathis CG.</p></div>\n</div>","meta_title":"Buy Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml | Free Delivery to HK | Sailfish Online Store","review_rating":9,"rating":4,"sale":true,"sku":"2657711","tags":["Sports Nutrition"],"vendor":"Spark","rrp":"4.99","new_sailfish":true,"margin":15,"airtable_group":"toShopify","product_categories":["Health","Sports Nutrition"],"select_store":"livehealthy","hkd_selling_price":117,"hkd_compare_at_price":142,"product_image":"[object Object]","images":[{"file":{"filename":"sparkigniteperformanceshot90ml-0","content_type":"image/png","width":800,"height":800,"id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a8747c","length":667120,"date_uploaded":"2021-12-14T03:32:33.184Z","md5":"bebc2723600c18b2337963024e5735b3","url":"https://cdn.schema.io/sailfish-e-commerce-limited/61b81050fde00a2b13a8747c/bebc2723600c18b2337963024e5735b3/sparkigniteperformanceshot90ml-0"},"id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87471"}],"image_alt_text":["Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml back image on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml from Spark on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Vitamins & Supplements on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK"],"product_type":"Health","product_images":[{"link":"http://host-62-113-119-20.hosted-by-vdsina.ru/Pictures/spark-ignite-performance-shot-90ml_1.jpg","alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml front image on Sailfish HK imported from Australia","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87472"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml back image on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87473"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml from Spark on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87474"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Vitamins & Supplements on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87475"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87476"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87477"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87478"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a87479"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a8747a"},{"alt":"Spark Ignite Performance Shot 90ml and Sports Nutrition on Sailfish HK","id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a8747b"}],"weight_unit":"kg","currency":"USD","slug":"spark-ignite-performance-shot-90ml","delivery":"shipment","tax_class":"standard","date_created":"2021-12-14T03:32:32.930Z","stock_status":null,"id":"61b81050fde00a2b13a8746d"}},"__N_SSG":true}
