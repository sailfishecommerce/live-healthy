Treats multiple corns.</p> <p>Scholl 2 in 1 Corn Express Pen</p><br/> <p>How is the Scholl 2 in 1 Express Pen different?</p><br/> <p>The new Scholl 2 in 1 Corn Express is a unique, highly effective and fast acting way to treat corns. It is reusable and will treat multiple corns.</p><br/> <p>What are corns?</p><br/> <p>Corns are amongst the most common problems to affect the feet. Corns are thickening of the skin in response to pressure. The thickened skin forms in a small cone-shaped (called a nucleus) that presses into the skin.</p><br/> <p>Is this the right product for me?</p><br/> <p>Scholl 2 in 1 Corn Express Pen is suitable for hard corns on the top of the toes and on the balls of the feet and for soft corns between the toes. Not recommended for use if your corn bleeds or hurts excessively. Seek medical advise as required.</p><br/> <p>What are the symptoms?</p><br/> <p>There are two main types of corns - hard corns and soft corns, both can be very painful. Hard corns usually develop on the tops of toes or on the balls of the feet, the 'point' of the corn nucleus can press on nerve endings. which may cause pain and discomfort, making it uncomfortable to walk. There is often an area of callus/hard skin overlying the corn which will usually be round and yellow. Soft corns develop between the toes where the skin is moist, making the skin of the corn feel rubbery.</p><br/> <p>How can I prevent corns?</p><br/> <p>Corns are caused by areas of high pressure, often caused by footwear or foot shape. To prevent a corn from developing you need to remove the cause of the pressure. Wearing well-fitting shoes that do not squash the toes and cushioning areas of high pressure may help to prevent corns.</p> <p>Boxed Contents:  Pen with Scrapper and 1 mL e Net treatment liquid</p> <p>Size:  1mL</p> <p>Reusable?:  true</p></div>\n<h2>Warnings</h2>\n<div>KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN <p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</p>  Visible improvement within 5 days.
